# Dashboard-HTML-CSS
Only HTML CSS used Dashboard project
In this project i used only HTML CSS and it is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop sceen sizes. 
This project was only for improving HTML CSS coding. So, i didn't use any Javascript files in it. Line graph and the pie chart in the index.html file is used as a image.
